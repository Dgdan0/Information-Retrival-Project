# Information-Retrival-Project

This it the finals project for out Information Retrival course.
In this project we created a search engine for the english Wikipedia that contains over 6 Million documents.
The search engine indexes the pages efficiently to return the best retulsts for a given query.


## Methods used in the project:

- Inverted Index
- BM25
- TF-IDF
- Cosine Similarity
- Eucladien Distance
- Page Rank



## Indexed Files:

- Title
- Body


## Search Engine Capabillities
  Our search method uses BM25 on both title (0.5%) and body(0.5%) of the wiki pages with a weighted ratio.
  additionaly we take into account each page rank to get the best query results.
